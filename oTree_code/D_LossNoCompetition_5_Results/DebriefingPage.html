            Thank you for participating in this study. The study examined how competitive environments affect happiness
            and social attitudes. To preserve the validity of the research, some information
            was temporarily withheld:

        <p class="section-content">
            <i>Financial Loss Was Simulated</i>：In the quiz, you were told that you might lose part of your
            payment based on your performance. <b>However, this deduction was only temporary.
            All participants will receive the full base payment regardless of performance. </b>
            Any bonuses you earned will also be added.
            This approach was necessary to comply with Prolific’s payment policy and to preserve the integrity of the study.
