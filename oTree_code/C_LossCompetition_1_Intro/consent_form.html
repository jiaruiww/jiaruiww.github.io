    <h3>Informed Consent Form</h3>

    <br>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Please read this form carefully. The purpose of this form is to provide you with important
information about taking part in a research study. If you have any questions about the research or
any portion of this form, please ask us. Participation
in research is voluntary, which means that it is something for which you volunteer. It is your choice
to participate in the study, or not to participate. If you choose to participate now, you may change
your mind and stop participating later. If you decide not to participate, that decision will not result
in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.

        <p>The person in charge of this study is Jiarui Wang (PhD student, principal investigator) and Ray Fisman
(faculty advisor). Jiarui Wang can be reached at <a href="mailto:jiaruiw@bu.edu">jiaruiw@bu.edu</a>.
        Ray Fisman can be reached at <a href="mailto:rfisman@bu.edu">rfisman@bu.edu</a>.
        We will refer to these people as the “researchers” throughout this form.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Why is this study being done?</h4>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to examine people’s decision-making behavior. We are asking you to
take part in this study because you are an adult residing in the United States and are registered on
Prolific. Approximately 800 participants will take part in this research study on Prolific.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Who is Funding the Study?</h4>
    <p>The study is funded by Department of Economics at Boston University. There are no investigators
that have any special interests or conflicts of interests related to the research.</p>

    <br>

        <h4>Procedures</h4>
    <p>We expect that you will be in this research study for approximately 15–25 minutes. During this
time, we will ask you to complete an IQ quiz and then answer a set of survey questions.</p>

        <p>Please note that there is a part of this study that is not being disclosed to you at this time. This is
necessary because revealing full details now could compromise the integrity of the research
results. After you complete all study procedures, you will be provided with a full explanation of
the study. At that point, you will have the opportunity to decide whether you
would like your data to be included in the research or withdrawn.</p>

    <br>


    <h4>What are the risks of taking part in this research study?</h4>

    <p>Risks of Completing Tasks and Survey Risks: You may feel tired after completing the IQ quiz.
        You can quit the study anytime if you feel uncomfortable. However, if you choose to quit, your participation will be terminated, and you
        may not be able to restart the survey.
        Loss of Confidentiality: This study is completely anonymous. Prolific assigns unique,
de-identified participant IDs to ensure privacy. No personally identifiable information will be
collected during the study. The main risk of allowing us to use and store your information for
research is a potential loss of privacy. We will protect your privacy by storing the data in a
password-protected computer. Any people other than principal investigator and co-investigator
cannot get access to the data, except the case where parties like IRB or Central University Offices
require to review the information for quality control or safety purpose.

research study may be published or used for teaching. We will not include identifiable information
on data that are used for these purposes. This study is completely anonymous. Prolific assigns unique, de-identified participant IDs to ensure privacy. No
personally identifiable information will be collected during the study. </p>
